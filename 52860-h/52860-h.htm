<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>His real name was Willy. But because
he was always on the look-out for any fun
or mischief, Father and Mother called
him “Wideawake” as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>One sunny day he and his little
friends went out to play cricket.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I'm going to make a hundred runs!”
cried Willy, as he took up the bat. But
when he had made ten, Freddy bowled
him out, and the other boys were glad
it was their turn to go in.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus004b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the
winter, father
made a big
slide, and
Willy and the boys went
down it as fast as they
could go. When he fell
half way down, Willy
thought it great fun, and
called to
his snowman
as he
glided past,
“Look at
me old
fellow!
Don't <em>you</em>
wish you
could
slide?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>On his birthday he had a party. It <em>was</em>
a merry time. They played “Blind Man's
Buff,” and “Puss in the Corner,” and
Willy always managed to catch the little
girls by their long curls.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was spring when Wideawake
Willy went exploring. He shot his Teddy
Bear, and tied it up in a scarlet handkerchief,
for he knew explorers ate bears.
Then he stuck a long feather in his hat,
and strode gaily down the road. Presently
he came to a big house. The door was
open, and a lady asked him to go in. She
showed him all sorts of wonderful things.
What he liked best was Chin Chan, the
Chinese boy, whose long pig-tail touched
the floor. The lady told Willy that in
China he lived in a boat, and helped his
mother look after the chickens.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>After seeing other Chinese people,
he went home and told his mother what
strange things he had seen.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Frisk was a dear little dog. He belonged to
Mistress Molly.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning Molly said, “Now Frisk, I am
going to the town, and you must stay and look after
the house, for Mother is going out too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frisk sat down in his little chair, and held his
walking stick between his paws.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one shall steal the dinner while <em>I</em> am here,”
he said. “Bow, wow!”</p>

<p class='c000'>On her way to the town, Molly saw her cousin
Tommy leaning over a gate.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/illus019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Tommy!” she
said, “If you are passing
our house, please look in
and see how Frisk is getting
on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Tommy ran off at
once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frisk <em>was</em> glad to see
Tommy, who gave him a
good drink of water from a
tub.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Molly reached
the town she went into
the baker's shop to buy a
loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when she put her
hand in her pocket she
found her purse had gone!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don't cry, my dear,” said the baker.</p>

<p class='c000'>And he left his shop, and went with Molly down
the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very soon they found the purse with all the
money quite safe inside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Molly saw a shop with “SALE” printed
in the window, and went in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning,
ma'am!” said the shopman.
“What can I get for
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want some stockings,
please,” said Molly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/illus020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“How do you like
these?” said the shopman.
“They are <em>only</em> one shilling
the pair, because it is sale
time!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They <em>are</em> lovely!” said
Molly, “And the scarlet
stripes just match my dress!
Please make them into a tiny
parcel, and I will put them in
my pocket.” Then she paid her money, and set
off home.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what had Frisk been doing all this time?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/illus021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>He soon grew tired of looking after the dinner,
and spied his master's hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bow wow!” he said. “What fun!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He poked his head into the hat, and though it
came right down on to his shoulders he didn't mind a
bit.</p>

<p class='c000'>He hopped into the garden on his hind legs, and
when the birds saw him they thought it was a
scarecrow come to frighten them away!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bow wow!” said Frisk. “I'm hungry!” He
went back indoors, pushed the lid off the pot, and
dragged out a bone. How good it was!</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a tiny mouse scampered past, and Frisk
pounced on it and killed it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/illus022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Frisk, Frisk!”
cried Molly, when she
came home. “You
<em>naughty</em> dog! I shall
never be able to leave
you in charge again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bow, wow!” cried
Frisk. “Bow, wow!
I'm <em>very</em> glad. For I'd
much rather go to the
town with you!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Jack always said he should be a
sailor when he grew up.</p>

<p class='c000'>No toy ever pleased him so much
as a boat, and he was constantly
imitating the ways of sailors, from dancing a hornpipe,
down to floating
about in a big round
tub on the little
stream which ran at
the end of the
garden.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/illus024a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Wouldn't it be
too lovely for words,”
he said on one
occasion when he
was taking his sisters
for a voyage in his
tub-ship, “if we could
go in a <em>real</em> big boat, and sail away across the sea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>And that is exactly what they did do! For one
summer day, Father and Mother and the children,
Elsie, Doris and Jack, all went on board a big boat
and steamed across the channel to France for a long
holiday.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Oh! what a glorious time they had! What fun
the bathing was, undressing
in the little
rocky caves and running
down the firm
sand, and then tumbling
into the water
with shouts of joy.
Then afterwards they
paddled and dug in the
sands, and searched
for shells and seaweed,
and thoroughly enjoyed
themselves the whole
day long.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was so
much to interest them,
too, in the little French
village, and they were
delighted with the quaint
dresses of the peasants.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/illus026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>One girl came to
bring them fruit and
vegetables, and the
children thought how
pretty she looked in her
snowy cap, coloured
skirt and wooden shoes,
as she lifted her little
sister to look for father's
boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jack, of course, was just in his glory, and never
tired of watching the fishing boats sailing out to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes he went on the water himself, and
soon learned to row, tho' the first time he tried, his
oar swung round and knocked him head over heels
into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, Father explained, was called “catching
a crab!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/illus027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards they
made a huge sandcastle,
and Jackie sat
at the top of it, singing:
“I'm the King
of the Castle!” at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he began
to examine some
shells and treasures
which he had been
collecting in his pail,
and was so intent on this, that he did not notice
how quickly the tide had come in.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he looked up he found, somewhat to
his horror, that he was quite surrounded by
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The castle was soon washed away; but not
before the “King” was rescued from his perilous
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Father waded out, and pick-a-backed him

  <h2 id='Doings' class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Doings of Dickie and Daisy</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Dickie and Daisy sat on the grass
reading. They had been gardening,
and were rather hot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let's go to the pond,” said Dickie.
“Nurse isn't here to say 'don't.'”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let's,” agreed Daisy. She always
agreed with Dickie.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We'll get father's rod and line, and
catch some fish,” said Dickie. So when
no one was looking they got the things
and ran to the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have the rod,” said Dickie,
“and I'll have the hook. Don't make a
noise or the fish won't come.” They sat
quite quiet till there came a big tug at
Daisy's rod, so big that it dragged her to
the edge of the pond.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id025'>
<img src='images/illus037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Dickie,” she cried, “help me!
I b'lieve I've caught a whale!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But before Dickie could catch hold of
her, in she went. The water ran into her
eyes and mouth, and washed her curls
quite straight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dickie was dreadfully frightened. He
made a grab at her, and she made a grab
at him. By the time she was safely on
land both were nearly as wet as the
other. Father's rod had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we'd better go home,”
sobbed Daisy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus038.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mother didn't wait to ask questions.
She hurried them into nice warm nighties,
and popped them into bed. Dickie was
soon all right, but Daisy caught a cold.
When Dickie got up he put on his
spectacles and brought out his watch. He
put his fingers on the little thumper in
her wrist.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must stay in bed” he said, “and
take Lemon Squash. Lemon is good for
coughs, so you won't get one, and Squash
will squash all the other poorliness out of
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Father heard he was very cross.
He said, “If you go near the pond again I
shall buy <em>another kind of rod</em>, and use
it too.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id026'>

their Saturday
tub for a long
time.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>“Sulky Sammy,”—that's what they
called me. I live in a stable, in a
big farmyard, and everybody used to say I
was the most disagreeable little puppy
dog they knew!</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning I was having a drink of
water when two other little pups came
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you come and have a game?”
they said.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I had a fit of the sulks on, and
didn't want to play with anyone, so I
frowned, and said nothing. Close by
Chick was having breakfast with her
sisters, and I
heard her say,
“There's Sulky
Sammy—disagreeable
again!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus045a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>I don't like
Chick. Mother
often says to me, “Oh, Sammy! How I
wish you were as sweet and gentle as
Chick!” And Master Mousie tells his
friends Mrs. Puss, and her three little
kittens, long stories of Chick's goodness,
and my naughtiness and sulks.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day I chased Chick out of the
farmyard,
and left
her all
alone in
a big field.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus045b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>I hoped
she would
never
come back any more, but Mr. Tortoise
found her, and asked Bunny and his
brother to take her home. That nasty
Bunny told everybody what I had done.
So Mr. Turkey chased <em>me</em> out of the farmyard.
In a field I met such a funny man.
Two birds sat on his arms, and one said,
“Everyone would be quite fond of Sammy
if he only left off being disagreeable!” I
trotted home, and began to try at once.
Nobody ever calls me “Sulky Sammy” now.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are four of us altogether—Kitty,
Tabby, Fluffy, and me.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we were very little we used to
live up in the stable loft with our Mother,
and she used to teach us all the things a
cat should know.</p>

<p class='c000'>We did not like learning very much,
but I don't believe anyone ever does.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was horrid having to wash our faces
every morning, and I used to wish I was
black like Kitty, then I need not have been
so particular, but Mother said that was all
nonsense.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we were clean and tidy, we had
breakfast out of the brown saucer; we
liked that, especially when Cook remembered
to sweeten the milk with lumps of
sugar.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as we were old enough to go
out by ourselves, we had fine fun.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one day Tabby very nearly got
himself into trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tabby, you see, was rather a bold, bad
kitten; he was always wanting to fight
people, and one day he thought it would be
splendid to have a quarrel with Mike.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mike was the black and white fox terrier,
who thought no end of himself; but
Tabby did not care a bit what he thought,
so he just stood in front of him, stuck up
his tail, and—spat as hard as he could.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>This was not at all what Mike was
accustomed to, and he got stiff all over, and
then—he growled and showed his teeth.
In another minute I think he would have
gone for Tabby, had not Miss Daisy picked
him up and carried him off. Tabby never
told me, but I believe
he was very
glad to find himself out of
Mike's reach.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id033'>
<img src='images/illus058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As this story is told by
me, I thought you would
like to have a picture of
me, taken all by myself, so
what do you think I did?</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew Miss Daisy had
been given a dear little
camera on her birthday,
and that she was making
pictures with it all day
long, so one morning I
went and sat on the
wooden chair in the hall,
just where the sun was
shining very brightly. I
sat quite still, and then
Miss Daisy and her camera came along, as
I felt sure they would, and I had my likeness
taken, and—here it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oh how proud I was of myself after
that, and Miss Daisy was so pleased with
me for sitting so still that she gave me a
beautiful blue ribbon to wear round my
neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alas! that blue ribbon was the cause of
great trouble to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I just jumped on the kitchen table to
look at myself in the glass, and—I upset a
bowl of milk that Cook had put ready for a
pudding.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>I jumped after it, and—oh what a lovely
feast I had; but my ribbon got all splashed
and wet—I was in such a hurry—and that
was how Cook found out it was I who had
upset the milk. She would not let me go
into the kitchen for three whole days afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was very dull for those three days.
You see, there were mice and all kinds of
nice things in the kitchen, and my whiskers
were growing fast, and that makes you feel
that you want mice more than anything
else almost.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third day I went and explored
in Cook's bedroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>All kinds of funny things I found in it,
and oh! such lovely slippers to play with.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took one of these slippers, one with a
big bow on the toe. I took it and hid it in
the garden, to punish Cook for being so
angry with me. It was a very difficult
thing for a kitten to do, I can tell you, and
I had to rest many times on the way, but I
did it, and then I went and sat in the sun
and watched, and what do you think I saw?
Why, that horrid person, Mike, must have
seen all I did, for he went straight to where
I had hidden it, and carried it off to Cook.
She gives him bones; that is why he chums
up to her. Oh, how I should have liked to
have—scratched him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must not forget to tell you about
Tabby and Fluffy and their “night out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the summer time, and they
had been playing all the evening on the
lawn, and then they disappeared.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>They never came in to supper, and they
never came in to bed. We never saw a sign
of them till the next morning, when they
came back looking as proud as you please.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then they told us what they had been
doing. They had been having a mouse
hunt in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had hidden under the big armchair
in which Cook sits on Sundays, and
then, when it was all quite dark and quiet,
they had watched the big hole by the store
cupboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a little while, two fat mice had
popped out, and then—the hunt began.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We caught them both,” said Fluffy.
“We had one each. Oh, what a lovely time
we had!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Next time they go hunting, I am going,
too.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day Kitty and I had a most tremendous
adventure. We went to the grand
Show up in London.</p>

<p class='c000'>The journey was not a bit nice, but we
kept very close to each other, and shut our
eyes up tight, and tried to pretend we were
not shut up in a hamper, but under Cook's
chair, waiting for the mice to come out.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we got to the Show we felt a
little strange, but we soon got used to the
noise and all the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must look our best, Kitty, Miss
Daisy said so,” I whispered. “We are
much handsomer than the other cats here;
let us show ourselves off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And we did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently a lady came and pinned a big
white card, with “First Prize” on it, right
in front of us. We showed ourselves off
more than ever after that.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is our picture. Don't you think
we deserved the First Prize?</p>

<p class='c000'>I do!</p>

One.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So do we,” said his brothers, and away
they pattered to the yard, where they found
a lovely saucer full.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Saucers are too babyish for me,” said
Kitten Number One, “I shall drink out of
the jug.” And up on the table he jumped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along came Silly Billy, the kid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will never do it like that,” he said.
“Bite a hole in the jug, like this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>What happened then, you can plainly
see by the picture,
and it is the
kind of thing
that does happen

Billy were safely out of the way, Mr. and
Mrs. Whiskers popped out of their front
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Milk, milk, I sniff milk,” squeaked
Mrs. Whiskers, and she began to drink up
every drop she could find, while poor Mr.
Whiskers sat and cried because he could
not find any.</p>

got to the scrap heap, where they ate till
they were like little round barrels.</p>

of a lovely plate of food, outside the
kennel where Jack lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the foolish kittens hurried to it,
and began to eat as fast as they could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of his kennel came Jack, with a
mighty shout, which sent the kittens rolling
over with fright. They never tried to eat
Jack's dinner again, and it was a long time
before they quite forgave Silly
Billy for being so silly.</p>

in a trap.</p>

tail and ran home, feeling very much ashamed of his

said, as they went on laughing.</p>

  <h2 id='Mrs' class='c004'>Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Puss-Cat</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus087a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Puss-Cat lived all by
themselves in a wee wee house. Mrs. Gamp was
a dear old soul with snowy white hair, and rosy
red cheeks, and such a smiling face and kind soft heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Puss-Cat had a lovely tabby coat, as smooth as
velvet, and a beautiful fluffy tail. Her eyes were bright
and twinkly, and she would sit in front of the fire
for hours and hours thinking of nothing but mischief.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day Mrs. Gamp was invited out to tea. She
put on her very best gown, and her new mob-cap
trimmed with ribbons and
flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she looked at herself
in the glass she felt
pleased!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id045'>
<img src='images/illus087b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Mrs. Gamp
had gone, Mrs. Puss-Cat gave
three loud purrs of joy, and all
the mischief she had been
thinking came out at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>She trotted into the
garden and got her feet
all covered with mud.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus088.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then she scampered
upstairs, and danced a cat
dance all over the clean
white counterpane on
Mrs. Gamp's bed. She
climbed on the washstand, and upset the water jug, then
she squeezed into the wardrobe, and pulled Mrs. Gamp's
dresses out on to the floor. And some of them she tore
to teeny tiny shreds!</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had finished she darted out of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>But alack-a-day! At the top of the stairs she
slipped, and fell—bumpetty, bumpetty, bump, all the way
to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently Mrs. Gamp came home. And the first
thing she heard was a strange noise in the kitchen. First
a miaou. Then a sob. Then more miaous. Then—sob,
sob, sob! She opened the door, and there, perched
upon a stool in front of the dresser sat Mrs. Puss-Cat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her head was swollen very, <em>very</em> big. Round her
neck was tied some of the ribbon off Mrs. Gamp's best
bonnet, and another piece was twisted round one fat paw.
And from her big round eyes great tear-drops were falling—splash,
splash upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Gamp threw up her arms. “Oh! dearie me!”
she cried. “What ever is the matter? Oh! dearie,
dearie me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miaou, miaou!” sobbed Mrs. Puss-Cat. “Oh!
my poor paw! My poor, poor paw!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Gamp's tender heart was touched. She rushed
upstairs to fetch some ointment. But when she opened
her bedroom door—well! <em>you</em> know what she saw!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id046'>
<img src='images/illus089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Her tender heart
grew cold as stone, and
oh! she was <em>so</em> angry! She
raced downstairs, and
gave Mrs. Puss-Cat the
biggest whipping she
had ever given her
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she took off
her best ribbon, and
opened the front door
wide.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Mrs. Puss-Cat
went slinking out
with her tail between
her legs, and a terribly vicious look in her big round
eyes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus090.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But Mrs. Gamp's heart soon grew tender again.</p>

<p class='c000'>She opened the front door, and called Mrs. Puss-Cat
back. And Mrs. Puss-Cat came at once, looking
very penitent and sad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Gamp gave her some nice hot milk, and put
her in a comfy basket in front of the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she sat by her side, and stroked her smooth
velvety head.</p>

<p class='c000'>And slowly all the naughty mischief slipped out of
Mrs. Puss-Cat's head, and nice, kind thoughts came in.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now she is really and truly the nicest Mrs.
Puss-Cat in the world.</p>

their home, Mr. and Mrs. Mousey by name.</p>

a corner close to the kitchen wainscot, and not far from
the larder.</p>

<p class='c000'>They made a cosy little nest of string and paper,
working hard all day, hardly resting till late at night.
As to food, Mr. Mousey soon found where that was to

there. It almost seemed as if things were left for them,

<p class='c000'>The very next morning six very tiny pinkish-looking
things were to be seen in the nest. They had
bright eyes and long tails, and would soon grow into
brown little animals like their father and mother. Oh,
how proud the latter were! Mr. Mousey could hardly
keep his eyes off them, and
Mrs. Mousey danced round
squeaking with delight. “They
are beautiful, my dear,” said
Mr. Mousey, “just like you.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus105a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me, my love,”
said his wife, with a proud look
at their darlings, “they are likely
to be as handsome as you.”
The parents embraced each
other tenderly, and then Mr. Mousey started off to
find food for the little family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every day the children grew bigger and stronger,
and merry games they had, as they chased each other
round the nest.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id052'>
<img src='images/illus105b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But, alas! their happiness was not to continue.
One sad day a terrible disappointment
awaited Mr. Mousey. He had started
off on his usual visit to the larder. He
returned almost at once, saying,</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear, we must move. I heard
the Cook say everything was to be put in
tins, so we shall starve if we stay, and,” with a shudder,
“worse still, she has got a cat. I fear she will hear the
children's voices, and we shall be caught.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So gathering their family around them they told
the sad news, and
glancing tearfully at
their cosy nest, they
crept sadly away.</p>

  <h2 id='Under' class='c004'>Under the Big Hat,<br /> <span class='large'>or, Jackie and Me.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Jennie and Jackie were twins. They had two
dearly-loved playmates, Fifie the puppy, and
Fipps the kitten. Fifie was nearly always
in disgrace.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day Fifie thought, “Now I will be good
to-day. I will sit in the field and there will be nothing
to make me naughty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But as he passed through the hall he spied
Jennie's doll on a chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” said Fifie, “Betsy Ann enjoys the fresh
air. I'll take her with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So he carried her off and carefully laid her
on the grass.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a while he grew fidgetty and then he
saw that Betsy Ann was staring at him with her
great eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don't stare at me like that!” he barked.</p>

<p class='c000'>But she took no notice and went on staring. This
made him so angry that he bit her foot, and when
it came off in his mouth he tore her arm, and
then rolled her over and shook and worried her,
until she was lying scattered all round him in lots
of pieces.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus112.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>When Jennie ran up with her ball, he was just
gnawing off Betsy Ann's left hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jennie was terribly upset about it, and when
Nurse came, Fifie was soundly smacked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after there were fearful mi-ows from the
pond. Jennie rushed with her butterfly net, and was
just in time to save Fipps from drowning.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been trying to catch fish in the pond and
had fallen in.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Jennie carried him home and put him in
Betsy Ann's bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jackie used sometimes to dab a little butter
on the tip of Fifie's nose just for the fun of
seeing him try to lick it off with his tongue and
roll his eyes round and round to try and see it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mother heard of Fifie's naughtiness with
Betsy Ann, she said that Fifie must wear a muzzle for
some hours every day until he learnt to behave better.
Poor Fifie! how he hated it and longed to join in the
romps with Jennie and Fipps.</p>

<p class='c000'>However he was so good for a week, that Mother
said the muzzle might be left off.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here you see Jennie with Fifie and Fipps,
celebrating the happy occasion with fairy cakes which
cook had given them.</p>

  <h2 id='Goose' class='c004'>The Goose Girl.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Gretchen was a goose girl. She
lived in a tiny cottage with a red roof,
all amidst the fields, and woods, and hills,
and every day she took a big stick and
drove her geese across the common to the
pond on the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>One summer morning her mother
said she might take a holiday, and go and
visit her Auntie Jeanne. So Gretchen
dressed herself in her best clothes, and set
out to the village. She spent a happy
time with her auntie, and after tea started
for home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just on the edge of the common she
met her geese.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they saw her they began to
cackle in great excitement, and caught
hold of her skirts. Gretchen drove them
off with her umbrella. But they only
waddled on a little way, then looked
back to see what she was doing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe they want me to follow
them!” cried Gretchen.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the geese saw her coming
they began to run, and Gretchen ran after.
On and on they went, over the common,
across the fields, until they came to a little
shady dell in a wood. And here Gretchen
stopped, and clapped her hands with
delight, for on the mossy ground was
spread the most delicious tea
she had ever seen. All around
sat a number of little brown
rabbits. Peter Bunny spied
Gretchen first.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id057'>
<img src='images/illus122a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Look, mother!” he cried.
“There's a little servant girl!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So there is!” exclaimed Mrs. Bunny,
staring at Gretchen. “What wages do
you ask, my dear?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id058'>
<img src='images/illus122b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Gretchen thought this
great fun. “If you please,”
she said, “I should be
quite satisfied with some
of those lovely cakes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As many as you like,”
said Mrs. Bunny. “Now go and fetch the
tea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The geese had vanished, so Gretchen
filled the tea pot from the little kettle on
the fire, and Peter Bunny carried dishes of
cakes. Then they all sat down, and
Gretchen had as many cakes as she could
eat. When tea was over, Mrs. Bunny told
Gretchen to go and play with the children
until bedtime.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What's that?” asked Peter, presently,
pointing to the umbrella, and
Gretchen showed him how it opened and
shut.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know!” he cried. “We'll go for
a sail in the air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried all the other rabbits,
and they dragged Gretchen and the
umbrella on to the
common.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus123.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>She opened the
umbrella wide, Peter
caught hold of her
skirts, and the other
rabbits joined
on behind,
holding on to each other's
tails. “One, two,
three—go!” cried
Peter, and the
whole party went soaring into the air. It
was a delicious feeling. Higher and higher
they went, until at last they were right
above the clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” cried Gretchen, suddenly,
“the umbrella's shutting up! Oh! whatever
shall we do?” Sure enough the
umbrella was no longer puffed out like a
balloon, but hanging loosely round the
handle, and the next moment it began to
fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We're tumbling into the sea!” cried
the rabbit at the bottom of the chain, and
there was a loud splash.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus124.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Splash, splash, splash! One
by one all the bunnies
fell in until only Peter and
Gretchen were left. All
of a sudden the umbrella
flew out of her
hands, and she awoke to find herself sitting
by the side of the pond, while her
geese were splashing in for their evening
swim. On the ground in front of her lay
the umbrella, but Peter and the rest of the
rabbits had completely disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope they're not drowned,” she
said, as she got up and peered into the
pond. But the water was so clear she
could look right to the bottom, and no sign
of a bunny rabbit could she see.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must have been a dream,” she
said, as she smoothed out her dress. “But
those cakes were lovely. So was the
journey through the air.” She picked up
her umbrella and opened
it, but it wouldn't lift her an
inch off the ground. So
she scampered home to
find mother standing in
the doorway looking for
her, but when she told her
story, mother laughed.</p>

  <h2 id='My' class='c004'>My First Visit.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>My name is Tim, and I am only a rough-haired
terrier dog, so you must not
mind if I make mistakes in this story,
because it is the first time I have ever told
a real, story book one.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought perhaps you would like to
hear about some of the people I met the
first time I went on a visit with my master.</p>

<p class='c000'>We went to stay at a big house in the
country. There were no other houses round
it, only lots and lots of trees, and they kept
the houses away, I expect.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we first arrived, I kept pretty
quiet The train had
made me feel rather
queer in my legs. I
wasn't frightened;
none of our family
are ever frightened of
anything—certainly
not of a silly old train
that doesn't even
know how to growl
properly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id026'>
<img src='images/illus137.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Well, after I began to get used to things,
I went out into the garden to see if I could
find someone to play with. It was rather
dull without Jo. He is my brother, but he
isn't old enough to go visiting like I do.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first there did not seem to be anyone
about at all. Then I saw an old wooden tub.</p>

<p class='c000'>I went and had a look at that. I have
found some funny things in tubs before
now—sticks and boats, bits of cork that
give you a pain inside if you eat them—but
never have I seen such a funny thing
as there was in this tub.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very small, with shiny black
hair, a shiny red face, and it was swimming
about just like a fish. It smiled at me all
the time, too. I didn't like that a bit, so I
barked as loud as I could; but it made no
difference. I could not make it out, and I
got very angry, so I walked off with my tail
in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a sunny corner I found the Duke
and Duchess. They were very rude to me
indeed. In fact, the Duchess spat at me,
just like the common Tabby family do at
home.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus138.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>I very soon left them, and then I found
Laddie, the fine old Scotch collie, but he
wasn't much fun; he is
nearly deaf, and he
was very busy staring
at some white woolly
lambs on green stands. Laddie loves those
lambs; he once ate one when he was young.
He told me so himself, and—it was much
worse than eating cork.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then I heard a great deal of barking,
growling and snarling.</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew it must be Bob, the bull dog. I
had been longing to fight him ever since I
came. I ran to the field as fast as I could,
my heart beating very hard, for Bob had
boasted to me of all the fights he had won,
and I was thirsting to beat him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I saw him, tearing down the field,
his tail tucked in between his legs, his ears
laid flat. He was running away from the
old red bull. He had made faces at him,
and then ran away when the bull pretended
to chase him. I wasn't going to fight him
after that. <em>I</em> wouldn't run away from an
old bull.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob ran into the kitchen, and pretended
to be asleep when I spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I went back to the tub after that, and I
just went straight up to the funny, smiling
thing, and—I kissed it. After that, we were
great friends, and had lovely games every
day till I went away. I wonder if Bob ever
plays with it. I will fight him if he does.</p>

when I, who work ten times as hard, am half-starved?”
inquired the wolf.</p>

  <h2 id='Day' class='c004'>A Day at the Farm.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>It was Margery's and Trixy's birthday; they were
exactly the same age, so they had only one birthday
between them, but they had always gone shares in
everything as long as they could remember, so they
were quite happy in sharing their birthday. And
what a splendid birthday this one had been! First of
all, they had been allowed to choose their birthday
treat, which was to go to Woodcote Farm.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had driven to the farm in the morning, sitting
on the box-seat of the waggonette by John, and as soon
as they arrived they had gone all round the farmyard,
and looked at the dear little ducks and chickens, and every
other living creature on the place. They had well shaken
the apple tree and filled their pockets with lovely rosy
apples. After dinner they had gone out into the big field
to have a game with old Dobbin. Dobbin seemed to
understand that the children wished to catch him by his
long tail, and would stand still until they nearly touched
him, and then with a toss of his head would gallop off to
the other side of the field, followed by the children, until
at last, quite out of breath, they had flung themselves
down under the willow by the side of the little stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>The afternoon was warm, and Trixy was surely
getting a little sleepy, when
Margery suddenly jumped
up. “Come, Trix,” she said,
“I hear the waggonette;”
and off they ran as fast as they
could.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>“We are off to the Front!” cried the three children
when they were ready for their walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you got all you want for the Front?”
asked their mother, laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, everything,” said
May. “Tom has a drum and
Bertie a bugle, and I am the rest
of the army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. Don't be too
long at the War, because tea will
soon be ready. Better go to meet
your father.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id059'>
<img src='images/illus152b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“So we will!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And away went the
three over
the white
snow in the
bright winter
day;
Tom beating
the
drum till it
was a wonder
the
parchment
did not
burst, and
Bertie blowing
the
bugle till he
had hardly any breath left. What a splendid
noise they all made together! Birds
flew out of the hedges and
rabbits scuttled away as the
army marched on, feeling very
warlike indeed; and
presently met the
army's father.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Please be our
General, father,”
they begged, “and
lead us against the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly,” he replied; “but first we will return
to camp and storm the tea-table.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So home they went in the same fashion, with drum
beating and bugle blowing.</p>

<p class='c000'>After tea, the younger children also volunteered
for the Front, and Uncle Bob was little Dick's horse,
for of course cavalry was needed. How Uncle Bob
pranced and galloped! The trumpeter nearly fell off
his back, but went on blowing the trumpet all the same.
Uncle Bob told him to blow it well away from the
horse's ears, so Dick sat backwards. As for Baby, big
brother Gerald put him on the rocking-horse, to be a
rough-rider.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The great thing is to learn to stick on,” said
Gerald, “because you will find falling off is very easy.
Hold the horse's nose, Nellie; it seems rather a wild
one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At last everybody joined the army, except the cat.
She sat on a chair and turned up her whiskers; for
cats like peace and quietness, and there cannot be much
of either when soldiers go to the Front.</p>

      <div class='line'>Come, Tommy,” he said, “come to school then with me.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He took Tommy's paw, and old Tabby Cat said,</div>

  <h2 id='Mister' class='c004'>Mister Jack-in-the-box.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>“Hullo, hullo, here I
am again!” cried
Mister Jack-in-the-box,
as he sprang up in a great
hurry one day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he looked all round him. He was
wondering what could have happened to all
his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is very funny,” he said to himself.
“I wonder where they can all be; they can't
have gone to a party and left me behind.
Besides, they have not had time to put on
their best clothes, for I have only been
having forty winks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was what he thought, but he had
really been asleep for a long time, and a
great many things had happened which he
knew nothing about.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently, Dobbin, the big wooden
horse, came walking slowly by.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hullo,” cried Mister Jack-in-the-box,
“How are you, my fine friend?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am looking for a hairy skin,” said
Dobbin, sadly. “Every horse is wearing
one now; the fashion has changed since
you went to sleep.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id073'>
<img src='images/illus158.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“But I have
only been having
forty winks,”
cried Mister
Jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forty hundred,”
corrected
Dobbin. “Here
comes Mister
Zebra, he will
tell you I am
right in what I
say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Mister
Zebra did.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don't know
what will
happen next,” he said,
tearfully. “I am told
that Teddy Bears are
always asked for now
that no one cares for
zebras. I do think it
is a little hard. I
know Teddy Bears are hairy, but not one of
them has a striped coat like mine.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id074'>
<img src='images/illus159.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Look at my legs,” said Dobbin. “No
hairy horse ever had legs like mine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I passed a whole new family on my
way here,” sighed the Zebra. “There was
an elephant that walked without wheels, a
boat with sails, a doll with a voice, crackers
with toys inside them, a Father Christmas
with a real beard, and——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A hairy horse!” cried Dobbin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A hairy horse,” answered Mr. Zebra.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cheer up, cheer up, you boys,” chuckled
Mister Jack-in-the-box. “There is plenty of
room for us all in the world. Suppose we
make a family all to ourselves, just we three
old friends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And that is what they did.</p>

  <h2 id='Fir' class='c004'>FIR TREE FARM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Fir Tree Farm was the name of the
big stone house, so the Squirrels
thought they could not do better than call
their house Fir Tree House, which they did.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were three of them, Mr. and
Mrs. Squirrel and Miss Brighteyes, their
daughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every morning at one o'clock they had
lunch on the big branch that was very high
up, because, you see, they knew very well
that James and John were about, and James
and John thought it fine fun to chase them.
James and John were a terrible pair of
pickles, very different to Joseph, the black
poodle, but then he was a Frenchman, and
he could not bear the ways of James and
John, whom he looked upon as common
terriers.</p>

<p class='c000'>They used to bark at him, and make
dreadful fun of him when he went out
shopping with his mistress, carrying the
basket for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>James and John longed to make him
fight them, but he never did, because
nothing would make him put down the
basket, and no dog can fight with a basket
in his mouth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus166.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Little Miss Brighteyes rather liked the
look of the pickles; she thought James was
lovely, with his black and white coat, but
she never ventured to go down and speak
to them—she was not brave enough for that—but
once or twice she threw nuts down on
the top of them, and this made them very
angry, because they were not at all accustomed
to be the ones who were teased.</p>

<p class='c000'>They used to get into trouble sometimes,
and many a good thrashing the
farmer gave them, especially on the day
when they snapped at the beautiful frills
Joseph wore on his legs, and made him
drop a basket of fresh eggs. They were
rather sorry for themselves that day, and
Joseph was so pleased that he did not know
what to do with himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor old Jane, the brown cow, found
them a terrible worry.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus167.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>They used to hide in the big wheelbarrow,
where her dinner was put, when the
grass was poor, and jump up and frighten
her when she came to eat it, and they didn't
mind a bit when she snorted at them—they
rather enjoyed it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id079'>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus169.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But one day Jerry, the old horse, who
lived in the paddock with Jane, spoke to
them very gravely about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now James and John had a great respect
for Jerry; they thought he was quite
the wisest person they had ever met, and
when he explained to them how very rude
it was to sit in Jane's dinner place, they
promised not to do it again.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day the farmer's daughter came to
Fir Tree Farm, and when she went away
she took James with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>John was very sad at first, and Miss
Brighteyes felt dreadfully sorry for him;
even Joseph tried to be nice to him, but it
was Jerry who comforted him best, and
gave him good advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he set to work to be useful, and
behaved himself so well that the farmer
used to send him to bring the horses in
from the fields.</p>

  <h2 id='Firefly' class='c004'>Firefly.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Through a sad misfortune Mr. Northcote's
beautiful estate had to be sold up. He was
a great rider and lover of horses; but everything
had to go, and Firefly, his beautiful bay, was sold
with the other horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the day of reckoning Mr. Northcote went
abroad. There success awaited him;
he worked hard to retrieve his lost
fortune, and after a few years he
returned to England once more a
wealthy man.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id081'>
<img src='images/illus175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>One day he hailed a hansom,
and before stepping into it was
giving the cabman the address, when
the horse grew suddenly restive and uttered a
strange whinnying sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What's the matter with yer?” cried the cabman,
giving the animal a touch of the whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don't beat him! He's all right!” said Mr.
Northcote, coming to the horse's head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again came the strange whinny, and the deep
velvety eyes looked into Mr. Northcote's like those
of a human being; and they spoke to him, too, as
plainly as words could speak: “Dear master!
Don't you know me? I'm your poor old Firefly!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Firefly! It's Firefly! My beauty!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, to the cabman's great astonishment.
Mr. Northcote laid his cheek against the horse's nose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To think you should have come down to this,
Firefly,” he murmured, with something very like
tears in his eyes. Firefly whinnied again softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor horse had changed masters several
times, and had had a hard life the last few years;
but all his troubles were over at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course Mr. Northcote bought him from the
cabman, and three months later, when the beautiful
spirited animal was galloping round the fields, it
was hard to believe he had ever been a cab-horse!</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Charlie, tired out with
play, fell asleep on the
nursery rug one winters afternoon.
“Hullo, Charlie!” said his sister's
biggest doll, walking up and patting
him familiarly on the back.
“Look,” she said, “there goes the
omnibus to Fleet Street; let us go
and see if there's room for us.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id085'>
<img src='images/illus178b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Charlie very soon found himself
riding on the top of his toy
omnibus, with the conductor driving
and shouting, and a wooden
doll calling out “Fare, sir; fare a
penny!” He drove along too
through his own toy village. “<em>This</em>
isn't Fleet Street!” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said the doll; “we are now driving to the Zoo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charlie wondered more and more, but he said nothing
until the omnibus stopped and all the dolls got
down. He found himself then hustled into a tiny train,
the engine of which whistled loudly, and had a piece
of cotton wool coming out of its funnel for smoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is the Zoo,” said the doll; “and there are
the animals going to bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charlie looked. Why, the Zoo was his Noah's
ark, and the animals belonged to it! “<em>This</em> isn't the
Zoo!” said Charlie.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point up came a very grandly dressed
gentleman doll with an eye-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This gentleman would like a game of nine-pins,
Lady Arabella,” he said; “pray come this way,” and he
led them to a lawn where a set of nine-pins were.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Those are my nine-pins,” cried Charlie.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense!” said the doll. “They belong to
this gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a very rude doll,” observed the possessor
of the eye-glass to Charlie. “How dare you say my
things are yours!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So they are,” shouted Charlie; “and I'm not a
doll, and you <em>are</em> one, and you belong to my sister, and
you are made of wax, so there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The gentleman doll grew very angry at this.
“How dare you!” he said loudly. “Policeman! hi!
Policeman!” and one came hurrying across the street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charlie laughed; he recognised one of the little
wooden policemen in his toy box.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush!” cried the doll; “the soldiers are coming!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Marching down the street came Charlie's tin soldiers,
all with drawn swords, and most of them on horseback.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charlie boldly
advancing laid his
hand on the bridle
of the general's
horse. Immediately
there was a great
clatter of arms, and
Charlie would have
been cut to pieces if
just then he had not
woke up to find himself
on the nursery rug.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>Bobbie was only a
little stable lad; the
only relation he ever knew
was a brother, whose
vocation was sweeping
crossings. One day, a
brougham ran over him, a
crowd collected, he followed
them to the hospital,
and was told his brother
was dead. The gentleman,
whose brougham it
was, came and spoke to
him, and then he remembered him taking his hand and
leading him to a big house. He was taken to the
kitchen and well fed, and after staying there a day or
two, was sent into the country.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus183b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wake, after questioning the delicate-looking
child, felt he could repay him for the loss of his brother
by taking care of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing to be done was to send him to one
of his farms in the country, where kind but rough hands
would do more than smoky town.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people he lived with grew very fond of him,
and treated him in every way as their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a terrier dog given to him by one of the
farm hands, and this he took a great interest in. Now
Floss was a good rat catcher, and as rats were most
destructive in the barn, Bobbie used to take Floss up
there, by the hour together, and hunt them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day he caught fourteen rats and mice and laid
them at his little master's feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On another occasion, they had been waiting some
time for a rat, which had made quite a home of three
sacks of corn in a corner of the barn, when Floss suddenly
darted round and sniffed one corner, and then
kept his eyes fixed on something which Bobbie could
not see. Floss moved a little on one side, and as the
rat made its intended escape, he pounced upon it. The
rat was also very sharp, and bit and scratched poor
Flossie's face; this worried him so much, that he gave
it one dreadful bite, which
killed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob was very kind to
animals, and took Floss to
bathe his face, and treated
him quite as an invalid till his
face was well.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c006'>The children had been ill with whooping-cough,
and as soon as they were well enough they
were told, to their great delight, that they were
going to stay at a farmhouse by the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! Mother,” cried Gerald, “do let us take
Nip with us! I am sure he would be miserable
without us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought you would want to take him,”
answered Mother, with a smile, “so I arranged
with the people at the farm that Nip should go
with you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The children were overjoyed at hearing this,
and rushed out to tell Nip, whom they found lying
in front of his kennel wondering what all the excitement
was about.</p>

<p class='c000'>A chorus of excited voices shouted the good
news to him, and he wagged his little
stump of a tail, and barked so
loudly that he made almost as
much noise as the children.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days later they were
settled at the farm, and
of course were charmed
with everything, and
were never tired
of visiting the
calves, the ducks,
the chickens, the
pigeons, and the
little baby pigs.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus187.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the children fed the pigeons Nip had to be
tied up, to his great disgust, because the birds were
afraid of him and would not peck up the grain while
he was loose. This, perhaps, was why he took a
dislike to the pigeons. “Stupid things!” he would
growl. “They can do nothing but sit and say
'Coo, coo!' all day!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Nip soon had good cause to change his
opinion. One day the farmer was going to market
ten miles away, and knowing that he would need to
send a message back immediately, he took one of his
carrier-pigeons with him. Some hours later the pretty
white bird flew down into the farmyard, and, tied to
its feathers, the children found a tiny roll of paper
containing the farmers message.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not so stupid, after all,” thought Nip, with a
sniff, and felt a little ashamed of himself.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
